# Focus-DETR
Focus-DETR is a model that focuses attention on more informative tokens for a better trade-off between computation efficiency and model accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art sparse transformed-based detector under the same setting, our Focus-DETR gets comparable complexity while achieving 50.4AP (+2.2) on COCO.
